paragraph.home.first = The project aims to integrate the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) and the DOJO framework. Indeed the DOJO framework is very rich in term of widgets and utilities (fisheye, slider, drag and drop functionality) and the main interest is to take benefits of the huge work which has been already done by the DOJO community.
